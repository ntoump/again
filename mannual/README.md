These are the images that I used to try out the accuracy of the model IRL. They were cherry-picked in the sense that all categories are somewhat represented, without the model having been trained on the specific images.

Only two out of these were mistakenly classified by the model, though with low confidence and mostly due to wrong data labeling on my part. 

Live and learn.
